        "Tree-of-Thought (ToT) prompting serves as a way to guide an LLM to resolve issues through a \"tree\" of smaller steps rather than producing an answer in one go. First, we establish what constitutes one “thought” for this specific task (in our maze, a thought equals deciding which next move to take using the current 3x3 view). Next, we request the model to generate a candidate move, evaluate it (prefer forward openings while backtracking is avoided unless it's the only choice), and follow a search plan (we used DFS with backtracking). To enforce reliability of the model, our prompts are strict: (1) reformat the full maze to one line using |, (2) reformat the 3x3 to exactly 11 characters, (3) output only exactly one allowed move, avoid backtracking unless absolutely necessary, and follow a strict order of priorities for stable behaviour. More broadly, the ToT framework is employed in several problems within which the LLM continuously maintains a tree of candidate “thoughts” and performs self-evaluation while integrating classic search algorithms such as BFS/DFS with look-ahead and backtracking.\n",

        "We report for each maze the success, total moves, prompt tokens, completion tokens and total tokens. In general, the number of prompt tokens tends to be higher because each prompt contains the whole maze and the 3x3 context grid, while completion tokens remain smaller since the model outputs one letter for the move. A higher number of moves tends to be related with more backtracking and therefore more calls which leads to more tokens. After the formatting prompts and the avoid backtrack unless necessary rule were tightened, the agent's behavior became more predictable. This, in turn, reduces excess moves and ensures token use is more uniform per maze.\n",

        "## Should LLMs be used for solving mazes\n",
        "I suggest utilizing the LLM as an assistant rather than the primary problem solver. Allow traditional methods (DFS/BFS) to manage maze state, legality checks, automatic backtracking, and stopping rules. Limit the LLM's involvement to small tasks, like selecting a single move from a small valid set and resolving ties, with strict input/output (how we flattened the maze, 11-char 3X3 and output one letter). It's much easier to control costs in this scenario as longer prompts waste more tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "What we observed in the lab supports this. The LLM may meander, execute the same steps, or overlook basic spatial cues without constraints. Tighter formatting and the instruction “avoid backtracking unless necessary” helped but still left some issues. This supports the evidence that LLMs are spatially and structurally uneven unless controlled with specific tasks and constraints [1]. Prompting with text-based spatial tasks will not solve the problem. The best performance was achieved with methods that incorporate basic parsing or logic alongside search to define a new hybrid approach [2].\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, I suggest using LLMs as an LLM-assistant rather than an LLM-only solution. For small classroom mazes, our Tree-of-Thought loop with strict formatting is fine and cost-effective. For larger or reliability-critical problems, an algorithmic solver is preferable, letting the LLM provide lightweight heuristics or rankings, while keeping iteration caps and token tracking to manage cost [1][2].\n",
