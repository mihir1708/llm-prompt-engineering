# LLM Prompt Engineering Experiments

A notebook-based exploration of prompt engineering techniques for large language models, with a focus on Tree-of-Thought prompting strategies.

---

## Overview

This project investigates how different prompt structures influence the reasoning behavior and output quality of large language models. Using a notebook workflow, it experiments with **Tree-of-Thought (ToT)** style prompting to break complex problems into intermediate reasoning steps.

The notebook documents prompt design choices, model responses, and qualitative observations to better understand how structured prompting affects problem-solving.

## Notes

This project focuses on qualitative analysis of model behavior rather than benchmarking accuracy. It serves as an experimental sandbox for understanding how prompt structure can influence reasoning and output consistency in modern language models.
